    "_Answer 3: By conducting simulations in the NVE ensemble, the initial configuration will determine the total energy within the system for the simulation, while the potential energy and kinetic energy can be freely transformed into each other so long the total energy remains conserved. This is directly observed in the molecular dynamics simulation with the potential increasing as the kinetic energy decreases. While the total energy is to remain constant, it can be noted the energy instead tends to oscillate with increasing time step increasing the magnitude of the oscillations. We can explain this due to 1. the approximation in updating positions and velocities correctly due to the usage of a finite time step in the numerical integration and 2. the numerical error arising from the computer, related to precision of the position, velocities, forces etc._\n",

    "Newton's equations tell us that if we have a set of particle positions and particle velocities at an arbitrary time, it is possible to predict the positions and velocities at any one particular instant in time. Therefore, classical dynamics of a $N$-particle system can be expressed by specifying the full set of 6$N$ functions ($2N$ for each dimension). The $6N$ numbers can be regarded as a single point in a $6N$-dimensional space named the _phase space_. The phase space is a Cartesian space and solving Newton's equations yields $6N$ tuples at different times which is considered a trajectory in phase space. Consequently, classical motion can be described by the motion of a point along a trajectory in phase space, with each point in phase space representing a possible microstate. \n",

One should note that at low temperature the molecular dynamics code will sample the single harmonic potential at all times for the NVE scheme, and for short simulations in the NVT scheme using the Andersen thermostat, while the Monte Carlo simulations generate a phase for the double harmonic potential._   \n",
    "_2. Monte Carlo simulations samples configurations by stochastic displacements of the particle position and thus samples low energy configurations due to the Metropolis algorithm, thus depending on the displacement parameter it is simply a matter of time before the particle will cross the barrier. In the case of molecular dynamics the positions are obtained from time-dependent displacements, and despite the Andersen thermostat being stochastic, there is still less chance to cross the barrier to the having assigned a velocity fast enough to cross the barrier._  \n",
    "_3. The phase space distribution within NVE is the sampling of a constant energy surface, while in NVT the energies are now distributed according to the Boltzmann distribution with low energy states being more probable than high energy states.
