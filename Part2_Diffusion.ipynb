    "## Diffusion from displacement of particles\n",
    "In this part of the lab we are going to calculate the self-diffusion of water from data of the positions over time. In the program, a textfile called _msd.txt_ is generated after a simulation has been run, containing the mean squared displacement of water as a function of time. The mean squared displacement of water is calculated by summing the squares of the oxygen displacements from their respective reference positions determined by their start positions, $x_{0,n}$, at predefined points in time. Then, for each sampled point in time, the sum is divided by the total number of water molecules,\n",

    "where $N$ is the total number of particles. \n",
    "\n",
    "If particles interact, they will establish a random walk behaovior after enough \"collisions\" have ocuured, causing the mean squared displacement to increase lineary with time. However, in the start of a simulation, it is common that one observes a non-linear dependence of the mean squared displacement on time. This is known as the _ballistic_ regime, taking place because not enough collisions have occured to establish the random walk behavior. Mathematically, this can be shown by considering two different cases,\n",

Run simulations with 216 water molecules for a series of temperatures (4-5 different, you choose which) and determine the diffusion coefficient of water for each temperature using the generated textfile _msd.txt_.
