    "## Diffusion from displacement of particles\n",
    "In this part of the lab we are going to calculate the self-diffusion of water from data of the positions over time. In the program, a textfile called _msd.txt_ is generated after a simulation has been run, containing the mean squared displacement of water as a function of time. The mean squared displacement of water is calculated by summing the squares of the oxygen displacements from their respective reference positions determined by their start positions, $x_{0,n}$, at predefined points in time. Then, for each sampled point in time, the sum is divided by the total number of water molecules,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\langle(x(t)-x(t=0))^2\\rangle = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^N (x_n(t)-x_n(t=0))^2\n",
    "\\label{msd}\n",
    "\\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $N$ is the total number of particles. \n",
    "\n",
    "If particles interact, they will establish a random walk behaovior after enough \"collisions\" have ocuured, causing the mean squared displacement to increase lineary with time. However, in the start of a simulation, it is common that one observes a non-linear dependence of the mean squared displacement on time. This is known as the _ballistic_ regime, taking place because not enough collisions have occured to establish the random walk behavior. Mathematically, this can be shown by considering two different cases,\n",

    "where equation \\ref{diff1} describes random walk motion, with equal probabilities to move particles in the positive and negative direction, whereas equation \\ref{diff2} describes ballistic motion, only displacing particles in the positive direction. The displacement parameter, $\\delta$, is assumed to keep constant over time. \n",

    "_Hint_: First consider one particle and sum over $n$ time steps. Then, average this sum by summing over $N$ particles. The first random walk mean squared displacement will show to increase linearly with time, whereas the ballistic one will increase linearly with $t^2$.\n",
    "2. Run simulations with 216 water molecules for a series of temperatures (4-5 different, you choose which) and determine the diffusion coefficient of water for each temperature using the generated textfile _msd.txt_. Plot the mean squared displacements for all temperatures in the same plot, calculate the corresponding diffusion coefficients and report the values in a table. \n",
