# Laboratory Exercise 1: Molecular Dynamics
This repository contains two laboratory exercises in relationship to the topic of molecular dynamics as a part of the course _tatistical Thermodynamics and Molecular Simulation (KEMM38)_ 2019.

## Usage
To open the Notebooks, we consider two options. 1. The usage of Binder (recommended). 2. Running the Notebook on your local computer.
### Binder
To open the Notebooks in Binder, simply click the Binder shield/URL in the top of the document or launch Binder by clicking [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsaem.8b00500).
### Local computer
To open the Notebooks, install Python3 via [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), and make sure all required packages are loaded using the following terminal commands
```bash
	conda env create -f enviroment.yml
	source activate MD_Lab
	jupyter-notebook
```
